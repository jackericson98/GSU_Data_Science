    "    In order to do this we would need to run a pointer on array1, a pointer on array 2 and have a variable that stores our last value of our output array. First compare the first elements of each array. If they are equal to each other, but not our last value of our output array, then we add the value to our output array and incriment both. If one is larger than the other, increment the smaller one. Repeat this process until the pointers have made it all the way through both arrays. This ensures that the time complexity of our algorithm will be O(m+n) exactly. \n",
