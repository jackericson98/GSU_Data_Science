    "    In todayâ€™s Lab we will explore on ways to do a de-duplication of videos where video filenames are presented as integers. For the purposes of our task, we will set a very narrow criterion for de-duplication : just the filenames: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Below is how the filenames are represented \n",
    "    ARRAY[] = [50, 11, 33, 21, 40, 50, 40, 40, 21] \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Below is the expected output after de-duplication \n",
    "    ARRAY[] = [11, 21, 33, 40, 50] \n",
    "    \n",
    "    ATTN : Notice the reduced size of the output array. Also, take a look again at the input array and be reminded that the input array is not sorted ! \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Further, please be reminded that you cannot use library functions to either sort and or perform the de-duplication operation. Doing so would straight up result in a score of Zero !\n",
    "    \n",
    "    You will solve the problem in two ways:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    (1) [100 points] Implement the function in such a way that your solution solves the problem with O(n log2(n)) time complexity overall and O(n) space complexity. Here, n is the length of the list of input integers (array). I believe the sorting routine that can be used here is Merge Sort. Please state as code comment which sorting routine you are using, sort the array with that algorithm and solve the de-duplication problem thereafter. De-duplication part of the solution in itself must adhere to O(n) time and O(1) space bounds. However, at this stage of the course we will not be considering any memory used by recursion."
