Question 2: Why would you need each of these stats?

Each of these stats can help explain the distribution of grades in our data set:

1. The mean tells us what the average value for all the students is
2. The median tells us where the middle student is. This can help us avoid being skewed by outliers. 
If 3 students got a 0 on the assignment the median would do a better job not being affected by those scores.
3. The mode can help us see where most people fall. If students are cheating or missing the same questions we will 
be able to see this in our mode
4. The standard deviation and variance tell us how wide our distribution is. If the entire class is doing similarly well
we will have a low standard deviation and variance, but if the class is all over with their scores the standard 
deviation and variance will be high.
